# devweek

This is simply a set of "placeholder" functions that are called from a Java flow func to demonstrate flow. Feel free to actually implement the funcs if you want. ;)


## Pre-requisites

You'll need Fn and Flow running locally or as a service.

Service: We don't have any supported service available yet.

Locally: 

* Fn: `fn start`
* Flow: see [flow](https://github.com/fnproject/flow)
* Flow UI: see [flowui](https://github.com/fnproject/flowui)


## To Run

to deploy: `fn deploy --all` 

to run: `fn call devweek flow`
